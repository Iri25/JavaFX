# flights-company
Java application with a 4-layered architecture: 
- data access layer with its validation ([domain package](https://github.com/Iri25/apm-project-Iri25/tree/main/src/main/java/domain))
- persistence layer ([repository package](https://github.com/Iri25/apm-project-Iri25/tree/main/src/main/java/repository))
- business layer ([service package](https://github.com/Iri25/apm-project-Iri25/tree/main/src/main/java/service))
- presentation layer ([controller package](https://github.com/Iri25/apm-project-Iri25/tree/main/src/main/java/controller)).

The data can be saved in memory and in txt files ([data package](https://github.com/Iri25/apm-project-Iri25/tree/main/data)). The type of repository must be changed depending on the choice of data storage. The interaction with the user is done through a graphical interface (GUI), developed in JavaFX (the fxml files are found in [views package](https://github.com/Iri25/apm-project-Iri25/tree/main/src/main/resources/views)).
